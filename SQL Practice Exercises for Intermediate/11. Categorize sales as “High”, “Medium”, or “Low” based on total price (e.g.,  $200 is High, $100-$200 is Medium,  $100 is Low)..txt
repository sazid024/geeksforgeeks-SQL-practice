Categorize sales as “High”, “Medium”, or “Low” based on total price (e.g.,  $200 is High, $100-$200 is Medium,  $100 is Low).

SELECT sale_id, 
       CASE 
           WHEN total_price > 200 THEN 'High'
           WHEN total_price BETWEEN 100 AND 200 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS sales_category
